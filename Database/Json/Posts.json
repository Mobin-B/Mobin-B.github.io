However, I would also like autocomplete  to add parentheses. This question was already asked using the Go programming language. I tried adding js.useCodeSnippetsOnFunctionSuggest as well as javascript.useCodeSnippetsOnFunctionSuggest. Neither of these work. I also tried useCodeSnippetsOnMethodSuggest as suggested here, but that didn't work either. What am I doing wrong?",
